          %p You probably already met atleast one client who wrote an usual simple message spread out into multiple emails. First the description of their projects, then images, then .pdf's. Managing this mess is not your work, you got something better to do, thus we invented ClientChat.

        %p But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects.
